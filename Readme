# Elasticsearch ILM Shard Allocation Audit

## Problem Description:

The goal of this script is to help you audit the allocation of Elasticsearch index shards based on their ILM (Index Lifecycle Management) phase. 

In Elasticsearch, ILM policies dictate which **phase** an index should be in (such as **hot**, **warm**, **cold**, or **frozen**), and where its shards should be allocated (on nodes with corresponding roles). This script checks for mismatches where:

- An index is in one phase (e.g., **hot**) but its shards are stored on nodes that do not match the expected node role for that phase (e.g., **cold** nodes).

## Solution:

This script compares the **ILM phase** of each index with the **node role** of each shard to ensure they align properly. Any discrepancies will be flagged, and the output will show which shards need to be moved to the correct node role.

### **What the Script Does:**

1. **Checks the ILM phase of each index**.
2. **Checks the location (node role) of each shard**.
3. **Flags mismatches** where the node role of the shard does not match the ILM phase of the index.
4. **Outputs the results** to a CSV file for easy review.
